He offers to purchase a supply of 12 birds a month at a price of GHC25 each. He praises her confidence and initiative. Before signing the contract, Lamisi agrees to pay for a veterinarian to assess the health of her birds (GHC350), and hires a Motorking driver to make her deliveries once a week (GHC40/month).",
