    <p>Put your skills and experience into action and join Canada World Youth and Youth Challenge International as a volunteer on our innovative youth development project, EQWIP HUBs.</p>
    <p>Located in six countries around the world, EQWIP HUBs are dynamic learning spaces where local young women and men benefit from employment and entrepreneurship training and youth-to-youth mentorship, and find the support they need to help propel themselves, their communities, and the world, forward.</p>
    <p>Our volunteers live and work in Bolivia, Ghana, Indonesia, Peru, Senegal or Tanzania on 3 or 12 month placements. Once they arrive, they work side-by-side with EQWIP HUBs staff and partners to offer the specialized training and support needed to help local youth launch a career, or business.</p>
    <p>Together, we can propel 100,000 #YouthForward by 2020!</p>
