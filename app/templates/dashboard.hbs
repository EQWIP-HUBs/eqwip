    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Ghana</p>

    <p class="u-textLeft">Ghana is a multicultural nation of over <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/ghana-population/" target="_blank">29 million people</a>, located along the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa. Over the past two decades, Ghana's economy has grown to become one of the strongest and most diversified in Africa. This growth has significantly reduced the level of poverty in the region. According to the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/ghana/publication/poverty-reduction-ghana-progress-challenges" target="_blank"> World Bank</a>, the poverty level in Ghana has been cut in half over the last two decades, however, due to growing inequality between regions and other economic challenges this trend is stagnating.</p>

    <p class="u-textLeft">Young people between the ages of 15 and 24 make up close to <a href="https://www.indexmundi.com/ghana/demographics_profile.html" target="_blank">19 percent of the Ghana population.</a> Though Ghana’s youth are attaining higher levels of education than ever before, their participation in labor markets has been in decline. According the 2015 Ghana Labour Survey Report <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/features/features/tackling-ghana-s-youth-unemployment.html" target="_blank">26% of youth are unemployed</a>.</p>

    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Tamale</p>

    <p class="u-textLeft">Tamale is the third largest city in Ghana, and the capital of the country’s Northern Region. Historically formed around an important trade crossroad, Tamale has in recent years experienced a high degree of development, which has produced a new stadium and an international airport.</p>

    <p class="u-textLeft">In Tamale, the informal business sector is by far the largest employer. Indeed, self-employment and small business entrepreneurship is very popular, and on the rise, especially among young women. Other important sources of employment in Tamale include agriculture, services and sales, crafts, the nonprofit sector, and the government.</p>

    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Accra</p>

    <p class="u-textLeft">Accra is the capital of Ghana, and its administrative, economic, and educational center. Accra and its greater area make up a sprawling metropolis of over<a href="http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/about-ghana/regions/greater-accra" target="_blank"> 4 million residents</a>. Accra’s primary economic activities are financial and government services, communications, construction, transport, and agriculture. The city is also home to about two thirds of the country’s manufacturing capacity.</p>

    <p class="u-textLeft">Though Accra is one of the wealthiest and most modern cities on the African continent, it is also beset by problems that include congestion, pollution, and poverty. Like elsewhere in Ghana, youth unemployment is a major problem in the capital.</p>

    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Northern Ghana</p>

    <p class="u-textLeft">In general, the Northern Region of Ghana is less populated and urbanized compared the most parts of the country, and has also experienced lesser rate of growth and prosperity. Among youth in the Northern Region, there currently exists lower levels of education and literacy compared to the general population, and a significant gap in these levels between men and women.</p>

      <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">How To Play</p>
      <p class="u-textLeft">
        As a young Ghanaian, your goal is to build a business that will be both profitable and sustainable. Over the course of 12 months, you will face a series of challenges, each of which will require tough decisions that will impact your business and your personal life. It won’t be easy, but as a driven and passionate entrepreneur, you’re up for the task, and down for the adventure!
      </p>
      <p class="u-textLeft">
        First, choose your character. Each character is has a different background, and will face a unique set of challenges as they seek to build a sustainable business over the course of a single year.
      </p>
      <p class="u-textLeft">
        Each month, you will be presented with a new scenario, and given 2 or 3 courses of action to choose from. The decision you make will impact a set of ‘indicators’, which will be located on the left-side of your screen. These include the following:
      </p>
      <p class="u-textLeft">
        <img class="htp-icon" src="/assets/images/icons/Cash.png"/> How much cash you have on hand. Ghana’s official currency is the Ghana Cedi (₵), which is worth about ⅓ of a Canadian dollar
        <br/>
        <img class="htp-icon" src="/assets/images/icons/Debt.png"/> How much money you owe family, friends and creditors. Monthly payments for this debt will come out of your cash each month.
        <br/>
        <img class="htp-icon" src="/assets/images/icons/DebtPayment.png"/> The amount put towards your debt each month.
        <br/>
        <img class="htp-icon" src="/assets/images/icons/MonthlyProfit.png"/> The amount of profit — revenue minus expenses — that your business is making each month. The monthly profit will be added to your cash at the beginning of each month.
        <br/>

        <br/>
      </p>
      <p class="u-textLeft">
